PrescribeGinie - Medicine Recommendation System
PrescribeGinie is a medicine recommendation system that utilizes machine learning, specifically Support Vector Classification (SVC), to predict diseases based on symptoms provided by the user. This system helps users get preliminary suggestions on possible medical conditions and corresponding medications.

How It Works
PrescribeGinie uses a pre-trained SVC model stored in a .pkl file to predict diseases. The model takes symptoms input from the user and predicts the most likely disease based on those symptoms.

Technologies Used
* Machine Learning Model: SVC (Support Vector Classification) trained on medical symptom data.
* Python Libraries: Flask for creating a web server, scikit-learn for machine learning operations, and other standard libraries for web development.
* Development Environment: PyCharm or VSCode (or any Python IDE of your choice).
